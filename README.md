# Project Horus Pre-Flight Check Web Interface
This is a quick little project to provide a simple web-interface to monitor the status of all payloads on a Project Horus balloon launch. It is intended to be a replacement to the [PiTFT pre-flight check](https://github.com/projecthorus/horus_utils/blob/master/apps/other/pre_flight_check.py) application, and will be usable from a mobile phone web browser.


## Dependencies
* Python Libraries:
 * [horus_utils](https://github.com/projecthorus/horus_utils/tree/master/apps/other) must be installed.
 * flask and flask-socketio

## Usage
```
$ python preflight.py
```
